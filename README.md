# Code-Refactor

## Description

As a part of the course curriculum, I was assigned to a "On-the-job" or "feature-request" challenge.
Given the starter code, I was assigned to debug a broken link on the web application, refactor the html doucment to include html5 semantic element naming, and to refactor the css document.
This project is the newly refactored "Horiseon" web application.
In this web application, all the links have been debugged, the html document follows html5 semantic element naming conventions, and includes an updated, consolidated, and re-organized css document with comments.

## Usage

To use the Horiseon web application, go to the link below:
https://inputname-jy.github.io/Code-Refactor/

The link should direct users to a webpage that looks like this:
![This is an image](/assets/images/HoriseonRefactored.png)

On this web application, users can click on the links in the header of the page to be directed to the selected section.
There users can read the information about the selected content.
